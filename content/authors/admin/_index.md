I'm a Master of Applied Science student and an active researcher under the supervision of {{< staticref "https://people.ece.ubc.ca/sasha/" "newtab" >}} Dr. Alexandra (Sasha) Fedorova {{< /staticref >}} at {{< staticref "https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/" "newtab" >}} Systopia Lab {{< /staticref >}} at the University of British Columbia. I like measuring the performance of big systems. My research interests are processing in memory, distributed systems, and memory systems. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, travelling, and photography. I tend to spend all my money on food and plane tickets; I have visited 30 countries in 4 continents.
